# Election_Analysis
This project utilised Python for data analytics specifically to disscet and extract information from data related to an election.
## Project Overview
Tom, a Colorado Board of Election employee, has asked for assitance in audting the results of the elections in a US Congressional Prescint in Colorado. He is looking for assistance with regards to two specific areas:
### Tabulation of the results
- Total # of Votes cast in the election
- The total votes received by each candidate
- The percentage of votes received by each candidate
- Identification of the Winner of the election based on the popular vote
### Investigate the possibilty of Automation
Tom wants to know if there is a way by which the process can be automated for use by utilising programming in Python rather than use the normal route of Excel as has been done in the past. The code developed to audit the Colorado elections, if successful, can then possibly be utilised by other Congressional, Senatorial Districts as well as Local Elections.
